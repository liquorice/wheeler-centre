<p>Speakers include feminist author Eva Cox, Robogals founder and former Young Australian of the Year Marita Cheng, political journalist and author George Megalogenis, Tasmanian Department of Justice secretary Simon Overland and medical anthropologist Gregory Phillips. Our host is writer and broadcaster Annabel Crabb.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>It was a wild night when Bret Easton Ellis came to Melbourne at the end of his tour for <em>Imperial Bedrooms</em>. At his most candid, BEE sets the record straight on Delta Goodrem, how <em>Mad Men</em> is better than any contemporary novel, why <em>American Psycho</em> is a great Father’s Day gift, and how he and Judd Nelson scammed <em>Vanity Fair</em> with their twisted take on Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Plus he tackles some feisty audience questions including “Do you ever wish that someone killed you at the peak of your career?”. And he discovers why he doesn’t do book tours that often.</p>
<p>Like any Bret Easton Ellis novel, the content is adult, so you have been warned.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>The Last Tuesday Society is an anarchic, absurd artist collective who come together regularly to present events of short performances and more.</p>
<p>In a madcap outing with a distinctly literary flavour, Last Tuesday is teaming with the Wheeler Centre to imagine what might have happened differently in various well-known situations: factual and fictional.</p>
<p>Our guests take liberties with the facts as they weave their own fictional endings, in song, sketch and story. With Bron Batten, Richard Higgins, Tina Del Twist, Josh Ladgrove, Laura Jean McKay, Joel Tito and Laura Davis.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>In the age of fast news, few resources and global technology, are foreign correspondents becoming redundant – or are they a vital investment in properly bearing witness? Three esteemed former foreign correspondents reveal experiences from the front, sharing on-the-job tales, stories of the long-term effects of the role, and a look at how it’s evolved over the years … from the days before email and mobile phones.</p>
<p>Take the long view with former <em>Age</em> foreign editor Cameron Forbes, Tony Clifton (ex <em>Newsweek</em> and <em>Sunday Times</em>) and Mike Keats, who has 50 years of experience as a foreign correspondent and editor. Hosted by Eleanor Hall.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>As our cities get more crowded, our transport infrastructure ages, and climate change brings new challenges, transport looms large as a knotty policy issue. What is happening at the cutting edge of public transport, and clean car technology? What’s the state of Australia’s public transport systems and road transport network – and why do we always have to choose one over the other?</p>
<p>Presented in partnership with Arts House, this edition of Question time offered one full hour of pure Q&amp;A between you, our audience, moderator Madeleine Morris, and a panel of experts in the evening’s chosen field of inquiry –transport. This event’s experts were Amandine Denis (head of research at ClimateWorks Australia), John Stone (transport planning academic at University of Melbourne), Angharad Wynne-Jones (creative producer at Arts House and director of TippingPoint Australia) and John Daley (CEO of Grattan Institute).</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>Pakistani stand-up comedian Sami Shah has been delivering punchlines from the frontlines of the war on terror for several years. He’s been profiled on Comedy Central, by <em>Australian Story</em> and in the <em>New York Times</em>.</p>
<p>Shah left Pakistan for Australia after being targeted by death threats; at home, he fronted his own satirical show and worked as a journalist. In his own unique comic style, he shares his story of what it’s like to leave the home you love to start a new life – somewhere your child can grow up safely.
In conversation with Rafael Epstein.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>The novella occupies a special place in literature – we all know it’s longer than a short story and shorter than a novel. Famous novellas include some of literature’s greats: <em>Breakfast at Tiffany’s</em>, <em>Wide Sargasso Sea</em>, <em>Animal Farm</em>. But what is it that defines a novella? What are its strengths as a form? And why are we still writing them?</p>
<p>In an event to mark Griffith REVIEW’s <em>Novella Project II</em>, Cate Kennedy, Megan McGrath, Jane Jervis-Read and Julianne Schultz kick around these questions.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Join host Sally Warhaft for this Fifth Estate spotlight interview with Greg Combet, where they discuss the Australian labour movement, the state of our democracy and parliament, the future of the ALP and life after politics for a man many thought a good chance as a future prime minister.</p>
<p>Greg Combet is one of the most influential public figures of his generation. A former leader of the ACTU, and parliamentary secretary and senior minister in the Rudd-Gillard Labor governments, Combet has been at the centre of some of the biggest battles and dramas in recent political history. He led the 2007 campaign against John Howard’s Work Choices and was Minister for Climate Change in Julia Gillard’s second ministry, before surprising many by resigning after the last ALP leadership showdown and retiring from politics in 2013.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Karen Joy Fowler is best known for her international bestseller <em>The Jane Austen Book Club</em>, a sublime comic novel of contemporary manners that Alice Sebold loved so much, she wanted to eat it (strange but true).</p>
<p>Her Booker-longlisted latest novel, <em>We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves</em>, is a daringly original exploration of family and loss, self and coming-of-age. It’s told through the prism of an unlikely psychology experiment (based on a famous real life one) – a girl raised, for a time, alongside an ape, by her researcher parents.</p>
<p>Meet this wise, warm and much-loved writer – and let her be your guide through the invented worlds of her novels, and the ideas within them. In conversation with Hilary Harper.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>Sally Warhaft is joined by James Brown, former Australian Army officer, now Military Fellow at the Lowy Institute, and Greg Barton (director, international, of the Global Terrorism Research Centre and co-editor of the journal <em>Islam and Christian Muslim Relations</em>). These distinguished insiders will lend their experience and insight in a special Fifth Estate on Australia’s defence policy in the age of ISIS.</p>
<p>As Australian hornets strike Islamic State targets over Iraq and our special forces remain on standby to once again enter conflict in the Middle East, questions arise about Australia’s defence and foreign policy priorities. Should we be focusing our intelligence and defence resources on global alliances or our own region? How binding is the ANZUS treaty and Australia’s obligations to United States foreign policy objectives? And what has changed within our borders with the rise of homegrown fundamentalists connected to a stateless, criminal terror network with no regard for human life?</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>A great speech captures the power and passion of its ideas; it’s an attempt to influence thought, or to commemorate a moment in time. On the publication of her updated anthology, <em>Well May We Say</em>, Sally Warhaft responds to some of Australia’s most significant speeches, on the themes of defence, women, immigration and indigenous affairs, in conversation with Stuart Macintyre and host Gideon Haigh.</p>
<p>Actors Bert LaBonté and Zahra Newman will bring these speeches to life, infusing them with new passion and meaning. Featured orations will reflect how these critical issues have evolved and changed with the times.</p>
<p>You’ll hear from feminist firebrands and political giants throughout Australian history, from Julia Gillard to Alfred Deakin, John Howard to Paul Keating.</p>
<p>Be carried away by the power of live speech … and reflect on the national contest of ideas, then and now.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Join national treasure and literary icon Thomas Keneally as he discusses his work, past and present with historian and writer Robyn Annear.</p>
<p>2014 is the fiftieth anniversary of Thomas Keneally’s first novel. He was the first Australian to win
a Booker Prize (for <em>Schindler’s Ark</em>, filmed as Steven Spielberg’s Oscar-winning <em>Schindler’s List</em>). He won the Miles Franklin twice.</p>
<p>Spielberg says he changed his life. Richard Flanagan says he ‘opened the space for me and for so many other Australian writers to follow’.</p>
<p>Fred Schepisi (who calls his writing ‘so beautiful and so descriptive and so clean’) waited years to get the film rights to <em>The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith</em>. This powerful story of a black man’s revenge against an unjust and intolerant society was shortlisted for the Booker Prize.</p>
<p>Keneally is also an acclaimed historian; in his multi-volume <em>Australians</em>, he brings the vast range of characters who have formed our story to life. Volume Three follows the nation through the decades of the Great Crash, World War II and the Petrov Affair.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Every lover of books, every writer and every great reader knows the score – there are thousands of amazing, obscure and underrated literary gems in libraries and bookstores just waiting to be discovered. And yet when you try to champion these cult favourites to someone at work, the inevitable response is, ‘Sounds good, but have you read <em>The Da Vinci Code</em>? It’s awesome!’</p>
<p>This year the Wheeler Centre is taking an alternative approach to our celebration of Melbourne Rare Book Week. Host Michael Cathcart, authors Emily Gale and Tony Wilson, and Sleepers Publishing’s Louise Swinn tell us about the books they wish were rare. The titles they’re sick to death of, the ones that make them shake their literary fists in despair.</p>
<p>Join us in the brand new Library at The Dock for the biggest literary takedown of the year as our guests rail against the might of hype, bad prose, the tired old canon, confused conspiracies and misguided monster hits.</p>]]>

Are there any questions or issues that Australian science fiction is uniquely positioned to address? And what’s so good about science fiction, anyway?</p>
<p>Doug Hendrie will talk to Jane Rawson, Lucy Sussex, Andrew Macrae and Max Barry about why they read and write in the genre, and what it means to be an Australian sci-fi writer.</p>]]>

With immeasurable influence – some much more than others – as confidantes, mediators, gatekeepers and advisors, the chief of staff steers the prime minister through the challenges and landmines of leadership, fine tuning and coordinating the things that matter to help win the support of cabinet, caucus and country.</p>
<p>What makes a great chief of staff? What are the challenges, pressures and principles that occupy their time? And what matters most in this powerful behind-the-scenes role? Prime Minister Tony Abbott calls his chief of staff, Peta Credlin, ‘the boss’. Kevin Rudd’s chief of staff, Alister Jordan, was referred to as ‘the wunderkind’, not always kindly.</p>
<p>Join Fifth Estate host Sally Warhaft with Anne Tiernan, associate professor at the Centre for Governance and Public Policy at Griffith University, and David Epstein, the first chief of staff to Prime Minister Rudd, to discuss the chiefs, past and present, and this singular job in the national capital.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Don Watson, award-winning author of <em>American Journeys</em> and former speechwriter for Paul Keating, takes us on a journey through our own national landscape and character, presenting the bush in all its complexity and contradiction.</p>
<p>Watson grew up on a farm in East Gippsland – he’s part of the bush. But what is it? The untouched wilderness, or the land worked by farmers, loggers and cattlemen? The past of Henry Lawson or the present of agribusiness and fracking?</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Travel writer, journalist and author of <em>Blood and Guts: Dispatches from the Whale Wars</em>, Sam Vincent takes an objective eyewitness look at the whale wars.</p>
<p>What motivates the war against whaling in the Southern Ocean – for both sides? Why does Sea Shepherd spend vast sums of money and risk activists’ lives to pursue a relatively low-impact hunt in isolated and perilous waters? Why does a rich nation like Japan doggedly continue a practice it started to feed its starving population during World War II?</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Robert Dessaix is one of Australia’s most cherished literary authors, acclaimed for his autobiographies, travel memoirs and fiction. For many years, he presented <em>Books and Writing</em> on ABC Radio National. In his latest book, <em>What Days Are For</em>, Robert shares his reflections from his hospital bed, recovering from a heart attack that threatens to kill him, as he reads the Philip Larkin poem ‘Days’ and wonders: what have his days been for? What and who has he loved – and why?</p>
<p>‘You will think some of the things I say are outlandish. But then: I love the outlandish.’ Opening with a reading from his book, Dessaix traces a path through travel, love, coincidence, intimacy, language, youth and death, in conversation with Ramona Koval.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Nearly 70% of Victoria’s Year 12 English texts are by male authors. And Australian women writers are still underrepresented in many arenas. How will the next generation of women see writing as a career that’s equally for them? And what about the next generation of readers?</p>
<p>To change this culture and inspire students – boys and girls alike – the Stella Prize has developed its own schools program. There are school visits by notable Australian writers, educators and publishers; hands-on writing workshops; teaching notes on all Stella Prize shortlisted books; professional development sessions for educators, and more.</p>
<p>Join Cate Kennedy, Tony Birch, Leanne Hall, and Bec Kavanagh for the launch, where they talk about gender bias in reading, writing and choosing literature for students to study.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>You know the saying: behind every successful man stands a woman. She’s doing his laundry, cooking his meals, and generally making sure he can concentrate on his public life – while she takes care of his private one.</p>
<p>She’s called a wife, and it’s a common joke among women juggling work and family that they would really like one of their own.</p>
<p>Even in this age of vastly improved gender equality, it still seems to be the woman who stays at home, or works flexible hours to do the ‘struggle juggle’. And it’s far harder for men to access workplace flexibility, or to make home life a priority without being judged.</p>
<p>In <em>The Wife Drought</em>, author and political correspondent Annabel Crabb calls for a ceasefire in the gender wars – and a genuine conversation about the personal, policy and workplace changes necessary for real equality. She’ll be in conversation with George Megalogenis.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>Today’s jobs have changed far beyond yesteryear’s projections. And instead of planning for one career, we plan for three or four. In this rapidly changing landscape, how can our education institutions meet new demands?</p>
<p>And in a world where old professions are disappearing, tertiary fees are rising, and unemployment comes with weighty obligations – how should the kids of today plan for tomorrow? And who’s being left behind?  We’ll look at global competition, the loss of manufacturing and more.</p>
<p>With Arts House Greenie-in-Residence Matt Wicking, RMIT interim vice-chancellor and president Gill Palmer, Futures Foundation chair Charles Brass and Centre for Workplace Leadership founder and director Peter Gahan. Hosted by Madeleine Morris of ABC TV’s <em>7.30</em>.</p>
<h4><strong>Question time</strong></h4>
<p>When you think ‘question time’, perhaps you picture rowdy politicians cussing each other out. But in our new series, we’re putting the dignity back into proceedings … along with a generous amount of time. It’s one full hour of pure Q&amp;A between you, our audience, moderator Madeleine Morris, and a panel of experts in the evening’s chosen field of inquiry. Get informed about the key issues of our time, in the lead-up to the Victorian state election.</p>
<p>In Programme Three of 2014, Question Time tackles three critical topics: renewable energy, jobs of the future, and the always-fraught issue of transport, now and into the future. BYO hot potatoes and burning questions.</p>
<p>Hosted by Madeleine Morris.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>Generations of us have grown up with Ian ‘Molly’ Meldrum beaming into our lounge rooms, signature cowboy hat on head – first on the ground-breaking music show <em>Countdown</em> which ran for 13 years, then on <em>Hey Hey It’s Saturday</em> (where his co-stars included a plucky duck and a puppet on a stick).</p>
<p>His music knowledge is encyclopaedic, but his real genius has always been his affable interviewing style, gentle anarchy and his genuine passion for pop music and those who make it. He king-hit Johnny Rotten, interviewed Madonna while Sean Penn sprawled on his bed, was buddies with Elton John and Kylie Minogue, and received a get-well card from the White House after the fall that landed him in a coma.</p>
<p>His connections with Australian music culture predate his on-screen days, though – he was a central fixture at pioneering music magazine <em>Go-Set</em>, which famously kickstarted Lily Brett’s writing career (she calls Molly ‘enduringly endearing’) and employed renowned music critic Robert Forster (also a Molly fan). At <em>Go-Set</em>, his first interview was with a little-known Johnny Young. And Molly produced Russell Morris’s pop classic <em>The Real Thing</em>.</p>
<p>In his autobiography, <em>The Never Um … Ever Ending Story</em>, Molly looks back over an extraordinary, eccentric and action-packed life – one filled with friendship, parties, outrageous anecdotes and colourful characters.</p>
<p>Join this beloved national treasure and sit back and be entertained, Molly-style, as he shares the highlights (and maybe the occasional lowlight) of his glittering career. Molly speaks with Triple M radio presenter/producer and former <em>Nightmoves</em> host Lee Simon.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Feminism has been a powerful force for change over the course of the last century, confronting inequality and changing the landscape of societies around the world. In the 1970s it surged into the art world, with the feminist art movement of the time challenging prevailing attitudes and assumptions.</p>
<p>Host Jane Montgomery Griffiths speaks to Mish Grigor, Juliana Engberg, Emily Floyd and Atlanta Eke about the ideas that drive their art and give voice to their passion for creating change. What is the future for feminist art? How can creativity generate real shifts in the structure of our society?</p>
<p><em>Presented in partnership with Melbourne Festival.</em></p>
<h4>Art and Change</h4>
<p>Arts and politics, creativity and change. The Wheeler Centre hosts riveting discussions with some of Australia’s most important intellectual and artistic voices as they explore the intersection between artistic creation and political action.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Broad-scale immunisation has saved millions of lives worldwide, making it the most effective form of disease prevention we have. Meanwhile, new vaccines and delivery methods continue to be discovered. Why, then, are vaccination rates at dangerously low levels in parts of Australia and overseas? What are the debates about the risks of vaccines and what are the risks to our health if vaccination rates keep falling? How do we make a difference to public opinion – and behaviour – when the science is not enough?</p>
<p>Hosted by scientist and writer Upulie Divisekera, with science-based medicine campaigner and researcher Rachael Dunlop, virus and immunity researcher David Tscharke and WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza director Anne Kelso.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>Both environmental and economic arguments make a case for renewable energy. But how is Australia placed to launch into that future? Our expert panellists take your questions on the decentralised electricity movement, support (or lack thereof) of our renewable energy sector, renewable energy initiatives overseas, and climate change – as both challenge and opportunity.</p>
<p>Hear an hour of questions served up to sustainability consultant Liam O'Keefe, ClimateWorks Australia executive director Anna Skarbek, environment and energy policy expert Matthew Warren and Australian Solar Council CEO John Grimes.</p>
<p>· See also: <a href="http://wheelercentre.com/dailies/post/3abae9fa4e76/">Good News and Bad: Australia’s Renewable Energy Future</a> in <em>Dailies</em></p>
<h4><strong>Question time</strong></h4>
<p>When you think ‘question time’, perhaps you picture rowdy politicians cussing each other out. But in our new series, we’re putting the dignity back into proceedings … along with a generous amount of time. It’s one full hour of pure Q&amp;A between you, our audience, moderator Madeleine Morris, and a panel of experts in the evening’s chosen field of inquiry. Get informed about the key issues of our time, in the lead-up to the Victorian state election.</p>
<p>For Programme Three 2014, Question Time tackles three critical topics: renewable energy, jobs of the future, and the always-fraught issue of transport, now and into the future.</p>
<p>Hosted by Madeleine Morris.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>A panel of leading Melbourne architects including Kerstin Thompson, Shelley Penn, Rodney Eggleston and Jon Clements, give their expert local perspectives on the built environment in our city.</p>
<p>They’ll explore whether our national architectural (or cultural) identity has been sacrificed to modernity. How do we house and cater to a population forecast to dramatically boom, while retaining our built heritage? How has Melbourne’s architecture come to define our city? And what role do architects have to play?</p>
<p>Hosted by Michael Heyward.</p>

<h4>Architecture in the City</h4>
<p>How does architecture influence our cities – and the way we live? What do we need to consider when we’re designing major buildings? In partnership with the Naomi Milgrom Foundation and the Australian Institute of Architects, we’re hosting two events – as a prelude to the new MPavilion project – that consider these questions from an international and local perspective.</p>]]>

      <title>Intelligence Squared Debates: Coal-fired Power will Soon be Obsolete</title>
      <dc:creator>The Wheeler Centre</dc:creator>

        <![CDATA[<p><strong>Download an audio-only podcast of this debate <a href="http://download.wheelercentre.com/141118_IQ2Coal.mp3">here</a> (mp3, 52.1mb, 1:48:26).</strong></p>
<p>Climate change is intensifying, but along with the repeal of the carbon tax, the price of coal has dropped – making it more appealing as an energy source. What lies ahead … for Australia and the world?</p>
<p>The Australian economy is largely propped up by coal, but is the end in sight? Is China, for instance, as reliant on Australian coal as we’re led to believe? And while many in the industry accept the science around climate change, what are the viable alternatives of energy supply to developing countries – is coal the only affordable option for those striving to escape poverty and destitution?</p>
<p>Renewable energy has not yet been developed at a rate (and for a price) that makes it a viable large-scale substitute for coal. Which begs the question: is our whole model flawed? The future of energy distribution could be local rather than centralised, with rooftops, co-generation plants and other small-scale technologies playing a vital role – avoiding the need for large systems of infrastructure for distribution.</p>
<p>Looking beyond the nuts and bolts of technology, what is the impact on communities of moving away from coal? Are we indifferent to the eclipse of the long history of coal mining? And what will happen to the communities that were once defined by it?</p>
<p>This debate was moderated by Wheeler Centre director Michael Williams.</p>
<h4>Speaking for the proposition</h4>
<p>· Bob Brown, former leader of the Australian Greens<br>
· Professor Mike Sandiford, director Melbourne Energy Institute<br>
· Lane Crockett, Executive General Manager, Pacific Hydro</p>
<h4>Speaking against the proposition</h4>
<p>· Dr Richard Aldous, CEO CO2CRC<br>
· Dr Nikki Williams, former head of the Australian Coal Association<br>
· Sinclair Davidson, professor of institutional economics at the School of Economics, Finance and Marketing RMIT, and senior fellow at the Institute of Public Affairs</p>
<h4><strong>Intelligence Squared Debates</strong></h4>
<p>Our Intelligence Squared debates broach society’s major questions – with knowledgeable, passionate panellists discussing polarising and very relevant dilemmas. In these highly participatory events, each team has equal time to make their arguments. When all is said, the victor depends entirely on your vote.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Alice Waters is a leading figure in the Slow Food International movement, and an advocate for fair agriculture and healthy, wholesome eating.</p>
<p>Taking her lead from the farmers and small producers who supplied her famous Chez Panisse restaurant in Berkeley, California, over the decades Waters has come to symbolise the importance of true seasonality, regionality and sheer dedication to fine produce and the best farming methods. Alice has been named as one of <em>Time</em>’s 100 Most Influential people and was this year’s <em>Wall Street Journal</em> Innovator of the Year.</p>
<p>Since launching her Edible Schoolyard project in 1996, she’s extended her influence to the cooks, farmers and eaters of the future, even inspiring Michelle Obama to plant a kitchen garden at the White House. And she comes to Australia from Terra Madre – the biennial gathering in Italy of farmers and food producers from around the globe created by the international Slow Food movement.</p>
<p>Meet this truly iconic figure, one of the most influential food thinkers of our times, as she presents her key ideas –then unpacks them with food writer Nina Rousseau. Introduction by Stephanie Alexander.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>In his keynote speech for the New News conference, Kim Williams talks about the future of journalism in the digital age, as the great information technologies of telecommunications, computing, publishing and broadcasting converge. And he offers his thoughts on how media organisations might make money in the future, and how journalism might be paid for.</p>

<p>Kim Williams has been a senior media executive for over 30 years, working in television management, film and television production, public policy in government and most recently as CEO of News Corp Australia.</p>
<p>This is a great opportunity to hear someone who has been at the helm of some of Australia’s leading media organisations, from News Corp and Foxtel to the Australian Film Commission and Fox Studios, survey our rapidly changing landscape – and make predictions for what the future will bring.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>As part of our masculinities series, A Blush of Boys contrasts the experiences of two adult men with two boys from St Martins Youth Arts Centre. Two boys aged ten and eleven discuss how they feel about growing up, alongside actor and performer Paul Capsis and author Tony Birch.</p>
<p>Former journalist and politician Maxine McKew hosts this wide-ranging discussion about what advice boys of yesteryear found most useful while they were growing up and what pressures the boys of today are facing.</p>
<p>What is it like to grow up as a boy in the second decade of the 21st century, and what sort of men are boys expected to become? As gender roles continue to evolve and are redefined, who are the role models for young males today, and what sort of message are they conveying to the next generation?</p>
<p><em>Presented in partnership with St Martins Youth Arts Centre.</em></p>
<h4>Men Overboard</h4>
<p>What does it mean to be a man – or a boy – in the 21st century? How far have we come in shedding the macho expectations of the past … and to what extent do we still perform our gender roles on a daily basis? Do we still believe that boys are made of slugs and snails and puppy dogs’ tails, or that real men don’t eat quiche? This insightful series explores masculinity through talk, performance and across the generations.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>More than any other artistic discipline, theatre has a long history of performers crossing the gender divide. But how does the artifice of a constructed gender performance relate to and comment on the fact we spend much of our everyday lives performing gender roles, often unconsciously? Are our entire lives a kind of performance?</p>
<p>Zoe Coombs Marr is an acclaimed writer and comedian whose show Dave has turned gender stereotypes upside down, while delighting sell-out audiences. Zoe is joined by Paul Capsis, an actor and singer who explores the notion of gender fluidity in his work, Jez Pez, a queer trans youth worker, and audio investigator Roslyn Oades. The final part of Roslyn’s audio trilogy examining courage is <em>I’m Your Man</em>, a revealing insight into male speech patterns in boxing, as heard through verbatim performances via headphones.</p>
<p>Together, they’ll look at how masculinity is portrayed in performance, and how rooted it is in the art itself, illuminating its many facets, flaws and strengths. This intriguing and subversive take on the male psyche will be facilitated by renowned actor and director Jane Montgomery Griffiths.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>In the midst of a global appetite for all things Scandinavian: furniture, television and especially food, superstar chef René Redzepi (Noma) offers an intimate look –through excerpts of his book, <em>A Work in Progress</em>– at one of the world’s top restaurants.</p>
<p>Redzepi’s Copenhagen restaurant, Noma, is ranked number two in the world – and he’s become a global success by focusing on regional, seasonal Nordic cuisine. It’s a philosophy that chimes perfectly with the times. He’s been described by the <em>Guardian</em> as ‘a gifted cook with an extraordinary palate’ and the ultimate antidote to ‘beige’ dining.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>PEN Melbourne, the Wheeler Centre and the nonfictionLab at RMIT University host a panel of journalists, advocates and academics to discuss the implications of the Peter Greste and Alan Morison cases – and what we should do about them.</p>
<p>Hear from Mark Baker (Chief Executive Officer of the Melbourne Press Club), Cece Ojany (Writers-In-Prison Officer with PEN Melbourne) and Alexandra Wake (Lecturer in Journalism at RMIT University). Moderated by Regina Hill.</p>
<hr>
<p>Peter Greste and Alan Morison are both Australian journalists who, with their colleagues, are subject to judicial action that challenges not only their own freedom but the fundamental principle of freedom of the press itself.</p>
<p>Our world is becoming more and more subject to political propaganda and spin; influenced by short media cycles and social media. A free and critical media is arguably more important now than ever. What do the Peter Greste and Alan Morison cases tell us about the state of our media, the value that we place on freedom of the press - and the role that we each have in defending those fundamental rights?</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>On 16th May 2014, the results of India’s national election were declared and a new government, led by controversial BJP leader Narendra Modi, was elected with an overwhelming majority. Meanwhile, front-runners were emerging for the Indonesian presidential election to be held on 9 July.</p>
<p>Both elections will bring significant shifts in policy and potential power in the region. What do these mean for Australia and its relationships in South and South East Asia? What are the ambitions and challenges for these rapidly changing nations? And how are their relationships with the Coalition government, nine months into its first term?</p>
<p>Sally Warhaft is joined by Professor Tim Lindsey, director of the Centre for Indonesian Law, Islam and Society, Dr Pradeep Taneja a fellow of the Australia India Institute at the University of Melbourne and Hamish McDonald, author of <em>Demokrasi</em>, for an enlightening discussion on new governments in the region and what it means for Australia.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>In part two of their conversation series in Melbourne and Ballarat, Sally Warhaft and Malcolm Fraser discuss more of the ideas from his book <em>Dangerous Allies</em> –a deep exploration of Australian politics, foreign policy and relationships with other nations. He talks about the history of our alliances, and talks about the indirect ways in which Australia could be implicated in new wars declared by other countries - including conflicts reliant on uncertain applications of international law.</p>
<p>Since he resigned from federal politics, former prime minister Malcolm Fraser has capped a long and distinguished career by focusing on human rights and international relations. In this captivating dual edition of The Fifth Estate, host Sally Warhaft sits down with the legendary figure in Melbourne and Ballarat to reflect on his political life and talk about his latest book, <em>Dangerous Allies</em>.</p>
<p>Australia has always been largely dependent on powerful distant empires for its security and for direction in how we should shape our foreign policy. In <em>Dangerous Allies</em>, Malcolm Fraser looks back over our dependence on Britain and the United States and examines how our status as an independent Pacific nation has altered this balance of power.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>Yotam Ottolenghi - creator of bestselling cookbooks such as <em>Jerusalem</em>, <em>Plenty</em> and <em>Plenty More</em>, as well as headline-snatching restaurants - is particularly well known for his creative approach to vegetables and vegetarian food, though he’s (in some circles, controversially) <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/27/dining/27otto.html">not a vegetarian</a> himself. (He shares with <em>Eating Animals</em> author <a href="http://wheelercentre.com/videos/video/jonathan-safran-foer/">Jonathan Safran Foer</a> the goal of having people eat less/better meat, rather than advocating for a vegetarian identity.)</p>
<p>In this video, he speaks with Melbourne chef Karen Martini –of whom he confesses he’s a fan –about his unconventional path to the world of food, his thoughts on the rules of homous, and his ideas about the different kinds of food he encourages people to be open to through his work.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>To discuss Julia Gillard’s time as prime minister, and to look more broadly at women with power in politics and public life, Fifth Estate host Sally Warhaft is joined by two formidable guests, Gold Walkley Award-winning journalist and former state government minister Mary Delahunty, author of the recently released <em>Gravity: Inside the PM’s office during her last year and final days</em>, and bestselling author and journalist Anne Summers AO.</p>
<p>Two years ago, for a small window of time, Australia had a female prime minister, attorney-general, governor-general, finance minister and four other senior ministers. Today there is just one woman in the federal cabinet – foreign minister Julie Bishop – and when she is away, there are none.</p>
<p>How is this possible in a modern representative democracy? What did we learn about the treatment of women in Australian public life from the rise and fall of Julia Gillard? And what is the personal cost for women in politics?</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Remote assistants respond to calls and emails. Life coaches assist with personal decisions. Smartphone apps tell us where to eat dinner. Nameologists help choose names for babies that will be raised by live-in au pairs.</p>
<p>Welcome to an emerging world, where the individual is a client in every interaction. Traditional functions of family and friends have been replaced by hired help and consultants. It may save us time, but what do we lose by handing over control of our personal lives to third-parties? Who are we if our jobs, our houses, our furniture, and our spouses are all recommended to us by experts or algorithms? If we are the sum of our decisions, then what’s left when those decisions have been handed over entirely to others?</p>
<p>Sociologist Arlie Hochschild looks at the long-term consequences of a frictionless existence and the implications of replacing the community with a marketplace in favour of faster, lonelier lives.</p>
<p>Arlie Hochschild is a professor emerita of sociology at University of California, Berkeley. She is author of several books, including <em>The Outsourced Life: Intimate Life in Market Times</em> and <em>The Managed Heart: The Commercialization of Human Feeling</em>.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>In this Fifth Estate discussion, series host Sally Warhaft is joined by anti-gambling campaigner and independent Senator Nick Xenophon and author Michaela McGuire, whose new book <em>Last Bets</em> examines the gaps between ethics and the law.</p>
<p>Australians have always loved a punt – on the horses, card games, two up or the lotto – but in recent decades the prolific increase of poker machines, casinos and online betting has given us the sad ranking of number one in the world for per capita gambling losses. Problem gambling and addiction has had devastating consequences for thousands of people. For everyone else, betting has changed our social landscape and intruded in many areas of our lives we cannot control.</p>
<p>Why do Australians love to gamble? What limits should there be on betting and advertising? What can governments and communities do to counter its ill-effects?</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Wayne Swan was treasurer of Australia during an extraordinary period of our politics.</p>
<p>He was at the financial helm when the world recession hit, and steered our economy through a time of unprecedented international economic challenges. Meanwhile, on the home front, the ALP was divided by leadership battles – whilst ruling on a knife-edge, as a minority government.</p>
<p>In this special spotlight edition of the Fifth Estate, Wayne Swan spoke with Sally Warhaft about his time as treasurer, key moments of his economic management of Australia, and the infamously complex relationships within the party.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Peter Carey is one of Australia’s great novelists – and the only one to have won the Booker Prize twice. In his latest novel, <em>Amnesia</em>, Carey leaves behind the historical fiction he’s best known for, in favour of a thoroughly contemporary situation – a ‘what if’ novel set in 2010, addressing the fiercest political concerns of 2014.</p>
<p>In conversation with Michael Williams, Carey explains that the book is in part a love letter to the Australia of the seventies and eighties. He shares anecdotes and insights into his early life in Australia –from magpie season in Bacchus Marsh to his childhood and schooling, studies at Monash University (where he failed in science), 1975 and the dismissal of Gough Whitlam.</p>
<p>Carey also unfurls themes from <em>Amnesia</em>, covering conspiracies, paranoia, Australia and the US, Julian Assange and hacking, and how to achieve verisimilitude in writing about the tech world. He discusses memory, the different motivations and conceptions of the world between and across generations, and touches on Australia’s cultural amnesia. And he admits to provoking those prone to reading his work biographically, by lending his hero Felix Moore much of his own personal history.</p>]]>

<p>Katakis is a man of many talents: he’s a travel writer, photographer, and manager of Ernest Hemingway’s literary estate. With Hemingway’s son, Patrick, he works to protect the integrity of the great man’s legacy – a job that takes him around the globe.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>In a compelling new study of the strange recesses of our minds, Adam Alter, professor of marketing and psychology at NYU, reveals the world is full of such hidden forces that shape our every thought, feeling and behaviour, without us ever realising.</p>
<p>Understanding these cues, Alter argues, is key to smarter decision-making, more effective marketing, and better outcomes for ourselves and society. In this short talk, he explains the concept of disfluency – and how making things easy to process is not always the best way to get people to absorb information, or to think things through. Carefully deployed, Alter argues that disfluency could be a valuable and surprisingly effective tool for communication and learning.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>In Jennifer Granger’s book <em>Feminine Lost</em>, she examines how traditional gender roles have been completely upended – and yet many have been slow to adapt to the new power dynamic. She is joined by writer and broadcaster Clementine Ford, author and commentator Benjamin Law and advertising executive turned broadcaster Ben Birchall in this exploration of the return of masculine terminology and the state of the contemporary Australian male psyche.</p>
<h4>Men Overboard</h4>
<p>What does it mean to be a man – or a boy – in the 21st century? How far have we come in shedding the macho expectations of the past … and to what extent do we still perform our gender roles on a daily basis? Do we still believe that boys are made of slugs and snails and puppy dogs’ tails, or that real men don’t eat quiche? This insightful series explores masculinity through talk, performance and across the generations.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>How have artists responded to the HIV virus creatively in their work, and what effect have their projects had on communities and attitudes as a whole? This panel of experts from around the globe examines the challenges of folding HIV narratives into creative work.</p>
<p>Sean Strub was the first gay, HIV positive man to run for federal office in the United States. His book <em>Body Counts: A Memoir of Politics, Sex, AIDS and Survival</em> examines how the AIDS pandemic laid waste to the LGBT community and chronicles how activism has been at the root of a deep cultural shift in attitudes towards the disease.</p>
<p>Joining Sean are Dion Kagan, Jessica Whitbread and Paul Woodward. Dion is an academic and writer who lectures on gender and sexuality. Jessica is a visual artist and activist, well known for her <em>No Pants No Problem</em> project. Paul is a British performance academic and storyteller.</p>
<p>Leading writer and thinker Dennis Altman leads this incredible panel in a discussion on how deeply HIV and AIDS have impacted the cultural community, and how their responses have opened enlightening and exciting avenues of change.</p>]]>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>In this short lunchtime talk, Mark Yettica-Paulson adopts a metaphor of three dances to argue for meaningful progress in cross cultural dialogue. ‘The dance of language is not about carrying around a list of trigger words to use or not to use given your context. It’s about listening for purpose, and practicing different types of conversation,’ he offers.</p>
<p>In 2010, Yettica-Paulson’s company The Yettica Group developed The Inter-Cultural Framework. This initiative was designed for a very specific reason. Having a clear understanding of the sensitivities and protocols surrounding Indigenous cultures is vital, but how do people involved in cross-cultural events attain this knowledge?</p>
<p>Mark has been at the forefront of establishing cross-cultural leadership groups in Australia for the better part of a decade, and in this Lunchbox/Soapbox, he argues for their importance in developing Indigenous leaders who can work within frameworks outside of their cultural backgrounds to promote understanding.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Chinese-born British writer Jung Chang’s multigenerational memoir of China, <em>Wild Swans</em>, was the highest-selling non-fiction paperback ever published, translated into 30 languages and selling more than 10 million copies. Twenty-three years later, it’s still banned in China.</p>
<p>Chang’s 2005 biography of Chairman Mao, written with her husband Jon Halliday, courted further controversy with its negative portrayal of the Chinese leader.</p>
<p>Her latest book <em>Empress Dowager Cixi: The Concubine Who Launched Modern China</em> is a biography of the legendary woman who ruled China from behind the scenes for almost half a century, reforming it in the process – including banning foot-binding and forcing the nation out of its self-enforced isolation.</p>
<p>In this video, Jung Chang talks to Australian author Toni Jordan about her work.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>In this lecture, presented by the Australian Centre for Jewish Civilisation at Monash University, Professor Jeffrey Shandler examines how Anne Frank’s story has been converted into a book of essays that challenge perceptions while still affirming the power of her diary as a physical symbol of connection.</p>
<p>Anne Frank is one of the most enduringly iconic figures to be associated with the Holocaust. Her famed diary has sold more than 30 million copies and has inspired countless other forms of media. In <em>Anne Frank Unbound: Media, Imagination, Memory</em>, New York-based editor Jeffrey Shandler explores the myriad ways in which the text has provoked responses from writers, artists, film-makers and historians.</p>
<p>Professor Shandler, one of the world’s pre-eminent experts on Jewish culture, is chair of Jewish Studies at Rutgers University and president of the Association for Jewish Studies. He is the author of several books, including <em>Jews, God, and Videotape: Religion and Media in America</em> and <em>While America Watches: Televising the Holocaust</em>.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Compiling a wide range of research from sexologists, behavioural scientists and everyday women, <em>New York Times</em> author Daniel Bergner turns the world of female desire upside down and inside out with his bestselling book <em>What Do Women Want?</em>. In this video, he’s joined in conversation by medical research scientist Krystal Evans (3RRR).</p>
<p>Bergner argues that female sexual desire is much more ardent than that of men, and explores the many dizzying types of female orgasm.</p>
<p>Disillusioned with a perceived bias in the field of sexual research, Bergner assembles a series of scientists who give a frank assessment of the realities of female sexuality – that lust and desire is a much more finely balanced equation than previously assumed.</p>
<p>Bergner’s findings – that women may be hardwired to be less monogamous than men, and be more sexually narcissistic – caused many an eyebrow to arch, including his own.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Too long the exclusive realm of men, women are successfully claiming the world of pornography as their own, and shaping it in a direction more suited to their desires. The rise of feminist pornography highlights the growing demand for explicit portrayals of sex by women, and for women.</p>
<p>Sex therapist Cyndi Darnell has devoted her life to the pursuit of pleasure, assisting countless women in realigning their sexual expectations. Award-winning feminist erotic filmmaker Anna Brownfield has changed the nature of sex on film for an entire generation of young Australian women. Gala Vanting is an erotic imagist, who retains ownership of her sexuality through photography and short films that challenge what it means to be a sexual being. CEO of the Eros Association, and the leader of the Australian Sex Party, Fiona Patten also joins the panel.</p>
<p>Together, these three women discuss feminist pornography as an expression of female sexuality. Honest, revealing and illuminating, this event gives conventional notions of pornography a firm and long overdue slap.</p>

<p>There are hundreds of billions of galaxies in the universe. However, if we’re asking who’s out there, we need to be ready with our response in return. What defines our humanity? How do we communicate the artistic experience of our world? Most importantly – who gets to decide? Artists, thinkers, bloggers and your average extraordinary person have never had a chance. In the face of such overwhelming power and scale, individuals can feel incapable of influencing a richer and more robust reading of our collective moment in time. Can you?</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Professor Rob Fowler is one of the nation’s leading experts on environmental law. In this lunchtime address, he outlines the pitfalls of the ‘one stop shop’ initiative, in which the responsibility for the protection and preservation of Australia’s environment will fall under the purview of each state, rather than the Commonwealth.</p>
<p>Designed to reduce ‘green tape’ and make it easier for business to access and understand environmental regulations, Professor Fowler questions how state governments will be able to negotiate international treaty obligations. How will the business sector be equipped to approach the uncertainty of eight different versions of environmental regulations? And how does this initiative fit in with a sustainable future for our nation?</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>How do you write about sex in an already sexualised world? Sam George-Allen is a Brisbane writer, musician and co-founding editor of online literary journal <em>Scum</em>. In this lunchtime rant, she analyses the literary merit of the sext, the performative nature of sex online and erotic fan fiction.</p>
<p>Today’s young writers may be the first generation whose sex education has been largely informed by online pornography. While much has been written about how this increased exposure to pornography might affect how they think about and engage in sex, the consequences for the new wave of emerging literature have yet to be explored.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>In this Lunchbox/Soapbox, Segal wrestles with the aches, pains and joys of joining an entirely new generation of people who got old somewhere along the way. Desire, sex, the relation to public spaces and today’s young people are all on the agenda, as she looks towards the challenge of finding a new way to experience a long and fulfilling life.</p>
<p>As a young woman, Lynne Segal rode the new waves of freedom in the 1960s and 1970s, living actively as an academic and feminist. Now in her 60s, she examines how her generation of baby boomers are coping with getting old. In her new book <em>Out of Time: The Pleasures and Perils of Ageing</em>, she draws on the musings of literary and artistic legends of the past, to see if we have learned anything about how to cope with the ageing process.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>The Emerging Writers’ Festival launches its 2014 program with the ultimate game of fact vs fiction. How often do novelists base their work on actual events? Do journalists exaggerate the truth for the sake of a good story? Do poets even know the difference?</p>
<p>Four guests from this year’s Emerging Writers’ Festival present their tall tales at the program launch. The trick is to convince everyone they are telling the truth, unless of course they’re lying. It’s up to you to decide.</p>
<p>The Emerging Writers’ Festival promote the interests of emerging writers – to improve their opportunities for professional development as well as their engagement with the broader public. Each year EWF brings writers, editors, publishers and performers together with readers for a festival that is an essential part of Australia’s literary calendar.</p>
<p>Co-hosted by Emerging Writers' Festival Director Sam Twyford-Moore and Wheeler Centre Head of Programming Simon Abrahams.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p><em>Saturday Paper</em> editor Erik Jensen talks about his fear of failure –and why it causes him to do things ‘ever more likely to fail’.</p>
<p>‘I think of failure as a huge and inevitable boulder, in front of which I’m always running,’ he offers. ‘Fearing it makes me get things done.’</p>
<h4>Epic Fail</h4>
<p>If you want to succeed, you have to start by failing, and failing big. If you haven’t experienced the downside, the frustration, the rejection, then how can you appreciate the sweetness of success when it finally comes?</p>
<p>Australians from all walks of life come together on one big night to revel in the obstacles they have surmounted and the failures that have propelled them to the top of their game.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>The Eureka Stockade is one of Australia’s founding legends – but until now, it’s been based on a band of rebel men, defending their rights amidst a barrage of bullets.</p>
<p>Historian Clare Wright reveals there were thousands of women on the goldfields, and some inside the Eureka Stockade. She talks to Robyn Annear about history’s forgotten women. Who writes history? And how does that dictate who makes the main story, and who we relegate to the margins?</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>As a journalist, musician and broadcaster, Sian Prior has spent the past two decades firmly in the public eye. During that time, she tried not to betray a characteristic she’s carried with her since childhood – her debilitating shyness.</p>
<p><em>Shy: A Memoir</em> chronicles Sian’s investigation into a condition that has always troubled her, exploring its impact on her family, friendships and self-perception. She tries to discover exactly what shyness is, where hers came from and how to manage the constant urge to withdraw from social situations.</p>
<p>Sian contributed a weekly column to the <em>Age</em> for three years, and her work has featured in <em>Rolling Stone</em>, <em>The Big Issue</em>, <em>Women of Letters</em> and other publications. For this session, she’s in conversation with Francesca Rendle-Short, author of the novel/memoir <em>Bite Your Tongue</em>.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>Bob Brown spent 20 years as leader of The Greens and has been involved in politics for most of his life. He has seen successive governments on both sides of the political divide come and go, and fought numerous campaigns championing human rights and fighting for the preservation of the environment. Throughout it all, he has managed to remain upbeat and optimistic. Where does this optimism come from, and how important is a positive outlook for propagating change?</p>
<p>In this talk, presented at Melbourne Town Hall (and introduced by Noni Hazlehurst), Brown explains the reasoning and the influential events that have shaped his belief in optimism as a powerful agent that can make a real difference.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Globalisation has ushered us into an era where the ability to travel almost anywhere in the world is at our fingertips. As more and more people hit the road, seeking out cultures and places previous generations could only dream of ever seeing, many unexpected and awkward questions are raised.</p>
<p>Do travellers treat other countries as theme parks? What responsibilities do visitors have? Does their presence help destroy cultures, or enrich them? Are we in fact moving towards a homogenous global super culture? Lonely Planet co-founder (and the man with his name in ours) Tony Wheeler sits down with a panel of travel bugs to assess the damage, the risks and the benefits of travel.</p>
<p>Joining Tony are Doug Hendrie and Laura Jean McKay. Doug is a journalist and author of <em>Amalgamations: How Globalisation is Good</em>. Laura is a writer and performer whose short-story collection <em>Holiday in Cambodia</em> was hugely acclaimed upon its release. Together they try to make sense of the place where local, foreign, national and international life and culture meet.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>In her candid speech at our Epic Fail event, Clare Wright explains that hers was not a humorous or whimsical failure. Rather, beneath the bonnet of her happy and successful personal and professional lives, she faced an epic challenge: severe clinical postnatal depression.</p>
<p>She talks about her initial denial of the illness, how she came to recognise her vulnerability, and how accepting it was a crucial turning point that allowed her to recover her mental health.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>‘I, and we, have failed epically to put a check on the privatisation of democracy in Australia today,’ offers former balance of power independent MP Rob Oakeshott, as he describes the challenges he faced –and lessons he learned –during his tenure in federal parliament, and reflects on what he would have done differently with the benefit of hindsight.</p>
<h4>Epic Fail</h4>
<p>If you want to succeed, you have to start by failing, and failing big. If you haven’t experienced the downside, the frustration, the rejection, then how can you appreciate the sweetness of success when it finally comes?</p>
<p>Australians from all walks of life come together on one big night to revel in the obstacles they have surmounted and the failures that have propelled them to the top of their game.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>‘I’ve written just about everything except greeting cards,’ quips bestselling New York novelist A.M. Homes, in conversation with Toni Jordan at the Wheeler Centre. ‘I’m looking forward to writing those.’</p>
<p>Homes' latest book, <em>May We Be Forgiven</em>, has been talked about as an example of the mythical Great American Novel – that synthesis of ideas about politics, history and the way we live now, woven into the lives of the characters who tell the story.</p>
<p>In this interview, she talks about the American dream, the difficulty of hope, and the serious utility of humour.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>In this lecture, Laura Bates walks us through the history of the Everyday Sexism Project and look towards a hopeful future by examining its positive impact on the lives of women as we work towards a truly equal society, free of prejudice.</p>
<p>With host Jess McGuire.</p>
<hr>
<p>Laura Bates started the Everyday Sexism Project in April 2012, in response to the persistent narrative espoused in the media and elsewhere that sexism is no longer prevalent in contemporary life. Having repeatedly heard that women now share the same status as men and that gender-based comments or so-called ‘jokes’ are simply par for the course and must be endured, Laura launched the website to provide a space for people to talk about the instances of sexism they experience in everyday life.</p>
<p>In its first year the site received 25,000 stories and quickly became a powerful agent for change. Laura’s subsequent journalistic work and activism has had a profound effect on attitudes regarding sexism. She has written on the subject for the <em>Guardian</em>, the <em>Independent</em> and the <em>Huffington Post</em>, as well as successfully campaigning against plastic surgery mobile phone apps for children.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Opening with a Florence and the Machine cover, during which he accompanies himself on ukulele,champion diver Matthew Mitcham candidly describes his disorienting journeys between the elation of success and subsequent bouts of depression-fuelled addiction. He offers his thoughts on how we might strive to keep ourselves and each other afloat.</p>
<h4><strong>On Water</strong></h4>
<p>There is no more precious resource on the planet than water. It comprises 60% of our body mass and covers 70% of the planet’s surface. We drink it, we bathe in it, and it surrounds our island. In 2014, the Wheeler Centre joins forces with the Melbourne Food and Wine Festival, presented by Bank of Melbourne, to explore the myriad ways we relate to water – how we’re using and abusing it, are dependent upon it for our survival and are sometimes powerless to stop it.</p>
<p>Eight guests, including Lucky Peach magazine’s Chris Ying, will present their personal and imaginative visions on water. Conservation consultant and editor Helen Doyle will examine the history and heritage of water supply in the Australian landscape.</p>
<p>Other guests include Genevieve Grieves, curator at Bunjilaka, Melbourne Museum’s Aboriginal Cultural centre, Oxfam Australia CEO Helen Szoke, and Olympic gold medalist diver Matthew Mitcham, each with their own unique perspective on H2O.</p>
<p><em>Presented in partnership with Melbourne Food and Wine Festival.</em></p>]]>

<p>What is the purpose of the Human Rights Commission? What are the priorities and plans of the new commissioner? And how will Tim Wilson’s beliefs and ideas on liberty and rights influence his work?</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>Australians are more culturally aware than at any time in our history, and many communities have turned to music, art and storytelling as a viable means of tackling social and economic problems. Are the arts being overlooked as an effective way of solving contemporary issues? What benefits can communities reap by adopting a more culturally integrated approach?</p>
<p>The latest edition of the <em>Griffith REVIEW</em> showcases such artistic success stories, examining the ways in which storytelling and greater creative engagement can transform communities. Contributor Marcus Westbury’s Renew Australia campaign helped turn Newcastle into a thriving hub of art and literature festivals, while Scott Rankin’s work has brought Australian theatre to international audiences and remote communities.</p>
<p>Marcus and Scott are joined in this panel discussion by editor Julianne Schultz and fellow contributor Robyn Archer, who explore the differences in cultural policy between Europe and Australia. Together they examine the profound and lasting effects of cultural solutions to social problems. Moderated by the Wheeler Centre’s head of programming Simon Abrahams.</p>]]>
